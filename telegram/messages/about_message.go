	return "*What is PredictStock bot?* \n\nWhen you ask a bot about a particular stock, it automatically connects to our database and gets the required information\\.\n\n" +
		"The database consists of two parts\\. The first part collects analytical material from all available sources\\. As a part of the analytical division of a small hedge fund, we are working with four platforms:" +
		"Thomson Reuters Eikon, Bloomberg, Capital IQ, FactSet\\. As a result, we cover almost 100% of professional financial analytical information\\." +
		"We also collect a paid analysis from popular sources such as Premium Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha PRO, Atom Premium, Morningstar Premium, Benzinga Pro, Zacks Premium," +
		"Stock Rover Premium Plus, Market Watch, Trade Ideas Premium, Benzinga PRO Essential, TrendSpider Elite Trade Plan, MT Newswires \\- PRO, Dow Jones Institutional News," +
		"StockPulse Pulse Picks Global, FS Insight, Bullseye Brief, Gimme Credit, Gordon Haskett Event\\-Driven Research, Hightower Report Daily Package, MarketDesk Research, " +
		"Nautilus Investment Research, RareView Macro, Vermilion International Compass, Wavestructure, CFRA Premium Pack, New Constructs, Wright FIRST, theScreener CIO, " +
		"GuruFocus Premium \\(the list is constantly expanding\\)\\. Together, these services help to assess market intentions for each stock\\. Not all sources give an exact " +
		"trade recommendation, however our algorithm does it instead\\. The accuracy of stock’s assessment of each analyst or service is analysed resulting in rating assignment\\. " +
		"It is important to understand that the rating is assigned to the analysis of that analyst or service for a specific stock, rather than to a particular analysis or service\\. " +
		"In most cases there exists a «specialisation» of analysts on a particular stock\\. The weight of each source for a particular stock is calculated according to the rating assigned\\. " +
		"These weights are then summed up and the analytical consensus for each stock goes to the second part of the database\\. \n\n" +
		"*What is PredictStock bot for? \n\n *" +
		"In case of doubt this bot helps to overcome uncertainty in making an investment decision\\. Certainly it is possible to trade against the market and these «heroes» are known but there are thousands of losers\\. " +
		"At the very least, you will be able to decide on the amount to enter the trade based on a consensus recommendation for a stock\\. \n\n" +
		"Why is the bot so cheap but not free? Our aim is to expand the bot to a global scale\\. We are successfully using it ourselves and we truly believe " +
		"that it is going to be beneficial and helpful for every trader\\. \n\n " +
		"Shortly we are planning to provide a list of top\\-rated stocks on a daily basis\\. Access to this channel will be more expensive, however its subscribers will get PredictStock bot for free\\."
